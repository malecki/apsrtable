<h2>Vignettes of package apsrtable </h2>
A comprehensive overview of the package, with a worked example of extending the function, was published in <i><a href="http://polmeth.wustl.edu/thepolmeth.php">The Political Methodologist</a></i> 16.2 (Spring 2009). The <a href="guide.pdf">implementation and extension guide</a> is based on that submission but is updated to reflect changes/enhancements.
