\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more fitted model objects of a supported class such as
\code{lm} or \code{glm}. The model-object (a \code{list}) may also
optionally contain an item named \code{se}: \code{model$se} may be a vector
of standard errors, or a variance-covariance matrix, in which case the
square root of the diagonal is used as the \dQuote{robust} standard errors
in the output. See the \code{se} argument.}

\item{se}{A character string controlling the quantities in parentheses, can
take the following values: \describe{ \item{list(list("robust"))}{Print
(and calculate significance using) user-supplied errors in an \code{$se}
element appended to the model object. } \item{list("vcov")}{Use the
standard errors contained in the second column of
\code{coef(summary(model))}. This behavior may be useful in writing
\code{\link{apsrtableSummary}} methods to customize output or format new
model classes.} \item{list("both")}{User-supplied errors are printed in
(parentheses) and the default are printed in [square brackets.]}
\item{list("pval")}{Prints the \eqn{p} value contained in the fourth column
of \code{coef(summary(model))}. Quietly switches \code{\link{se.note}} to
say \dQuote{(Robust) \eqn{p} values in parentheses.} Robust values are used
(and so labeled contextually) whenever an \code{$se} element is present in
any model.} } If any model in \code{...} contains an \code{se} element and
\dQuote{robust} is chosen (the default), output is labeled as
\dQuote{robust;} if no models have an \code{se} element (all use model
vcov) but \code{se="robust"}, labeling is simply \dQuote{Standard errors in
parentheses.} Default = "robust"}

\item{model.names}{Optional vector of names to use as column headings in
the table. If more models than names are supplied, unnamed models are
numbered (starting at one more than the number of names).}

\item{model.counter}{Change the number to start counting from when using
automatically numbered models. Default = 1.}

\item{digits}{Number of decimal places to report. Default = 2}

\item{stars}{Show statistical significance \dQuote{stars}, either
\dQuote{1} or \dQuote{default} where \dQuote{default} is based on the
output of \code{summary.lm}, except that a superscript dagger is used
instead of a dot for \eqn{p < .10}. Here \dQuote{default} means \dQuote{the
R default}, not to be confused with the function's (perhaps confusing)
Default=1}

\item{lev}{When \code{stars=1}, what level should be used for the test to
reject statistical insignificance and bestow the glittering star? Disable
decoration entirely by specifying \code{lev=0}. Default=.05.}

\item{align}{How should columns be aligned in the output? Model summaries
are always decimal-aligned using dcolumn (and therefore also set in math
mode), but dcolumn also provides for decimal-point centering. Model names
are set in \dQuote{\special{\multicolumn}} spans with alignment given here, as are
model terms (leftmost column of table). Default = \dQuote{left}.}

\item{order}{Determines the order in which terms (rows) are included in the
output when more than one model (column) is present. \dQuote{lr} and
\dQuote{rl} take the order of terms from the first or last (leftmost or
rightmost) model and appends new terms as they are encountered.
\dQuote{longest} uses the order of terms in the model with the most
terms.Default = \dQuote{lr}.}

\item{notes}{A list to be evaluated and placed, one item per full-width
(multicolumn) line, in footnote size. The default uses two functions,
\code{\link{se.note}} and \code{\link{stars.note}} to generate notes about
the standard errors and indicators of statistical significance. Other notes
can be named function calls or simple character strings.}

\item{omitcoef}{An optional integer or character vector of coefficient
indices, or an \link{expression} involving \code{coefnames} that evaluates
to integer or character, of rows to exclude from the output. See details.}

\item{coef.names}{An optional vector of names for coefficients. It is
recommended to establish the \code{omitcoef} and \code{order} settings with
automatic symbolic naming before supplying a vector of \dQuote{pretty}
variable names. If automatic symbolic naming is used, names are taken from
the variables in the models and \dQuote{sanitized} for latex. If
\code{coef.names} are supplied, they must be valid latex, with
double-backslash escape characters.}

\item{coef.rows}{The number of rows in the table given to each coefficient:
by default each coefficient's standard error is printed in a row beneath
it, but setting \code{coef.rows} to 1 places it in a new column to the
right instead.}

\item{multicolumn.align}{Alignment for the table's \code{multicolumn}
spans: typically only the model names at the top, but, in the case of
\code{coef.rows=1}, the \code{model.info} is also aligned beneath both
columns. Default=\dQuote{center}}

\item{col.hspace}{Optional \code{hspace} (number+tex units such as
\code{em}) to insert between each model column(s). Intended mainly to
separate models from each other when \code{coef.rows=1}. Default=NULL}

\item{Sweave}{Toggle whether to include \dQuote{\special{\begin{table}...\end{table}}},
label, and caption, or only the \dQuote{\special{\begin{tabular} ... \end{tabular}}}.
When called from within an \code{Sweave} document one would typically write
such elements in the \dQuote{documentation} (latex-part) rather than inside
the code chunk. When called from an \code{Sweave} document, make sure to
set the code chunk option \code{results=tex}. Default = FALSE}

\item{float}{if \code{Sweave} is false -- that is, if \emph{apsrtable} is
supposed to wrap the output in the float environment, \code{float} allows
you to specify an arbitrary custom float environment. Some useful ones
include \dQuote{sidewaystable} (latex package \emph{rotating}), or
\dQuote{longtable}. In the special case of \dQuote{longtable}, the header
row of model names is included on all pages, and the \code{label} and
\code{caption} arguments are included \emph{even when \code{Sweave=TRUE}}
because of the structure of the latex environment.}

\item{Minionfig}{Include latex command to change the figure style to
\dQuote{tabular} and back to \dQuote{proportional}, specifically for the
\code{MinionPro} latex package. Default = FALSE}

\item{label}{A string to be used as the label in latex for the table. Used
only when \code{Sweave=FALSE}, unless \code{float="longtable"}.}

\item{caption}{A latex string to be used as the caption for the table
(remember to use double backslashes for latex commands in R).  Used only
when \code{Sweave=FALSE}, unless \code{float="longtable"}.}

\item{caption.position}{Determines the placement of the caption and label
with respect to the tabular environment. (Not thoroughly tested with
alternative float environments, but should work with the standard
\code{table/tabular} combination.) Default=\code{"above"}}
}
\value{
A character vector containing lines of latex code. It can be
written out using \code{writeLines} for inclusion via \dQuote{\special{\input}} in
latex documents.
}
\description{
Produce well-formatted LaTeX tables of multiple models side-by-side.
}
\details{
*** Requires \dQuote{\special{\usepackage{dcolumn}}} in Latex/Sweave preamble. ***

Given one or several model objects of various types, \code{apsrtable()}
will produce side-by-side output in well-formatted LaTeX using either
automated numbering or user-supplied model names and \code{dcolumn}
decimal-aligned columns. Terms are matched across rows, with options for
determining the order of terms. Nuisance terms (e.g. controls, or other
quantities not of primary interest) may be omitted. Standard errors of
parameter estimates are placed below estimates and in parentheses, with the
option for the user to supply a replacement vector of standard errors or a
replacement variance-covariance matrix, such as one estimated using the
\code{sandwich} package. By default a single star denotes statistical
significance at the .05 level, with the option to employ further
decorations or specify another arbitrary level for the test. Finally, some
model diagnostics are included along with a (somewhat) flexible means to
program or include different items depending on model object class.

The argument \code{omitcoef} suppresses the output of specific rows. It may
be either a valid subscript index (integer or logical if opacity is
desired, or character for transparency), or an \code{\link{expression}},
such as a \code{\link{grep}} expression to be evaluated with respect to
\code{coefnames} (without a dot). The internal object\code{coefnames} is
the union of all model terms, in the desired \code{order}. In the example
below, \dQuote{(Intercept)} is excluded by a regular expression matching
the parenthesis.

To exclude multiple regular expressions, or a mix of expressions with other
types, you may supply a \link{list}, but you must ensure that the result is
a valid subscript list: all character, all numeric, or all logical. For
example, if you refer to a specific coefficient by its character name,
include the argument \code{value=TRUE} in any \code{\link{grep}}
expressions in the list.

Model diagnostic information (\dQuote{model info}) is handled by formal
\code{\link{modelInfo}} methods defined for model summaries. These methods
return lists of S3 class \code{model.info}, named formatted (character)
elements. To include fit (or other) information that is available from
fitted model objects but \emph{not their summaries,} write an
\code{\link{apsrtableSummary}} method to prepare a summary with the items
needed for your own \code{modelInfo} method.

Included are modelInfo functions for \code{lm}, \code{glm}, and \code{
\link[AER]{tobit}}, \code{\link[survival]{coxph}},
\code{\link[survival]{clogit}}, and a skeleton (incomplete
\code{modelInfo}) for \code{\link[gee]{gee}} and
\code{\link[survey]{svyglm}} objects. Please email the author any
\code{modelInfo} functions you write for different model objects for
inclusion in future releases.
